# MyGenome
*The following is a basic record of the methods and results from the whole genome assembly of rice blast fungus, Pyricularia oryzae.*

## Sequence quality assessment
Upon upload of the sequences as .gz files, both forward and reverse sequences were run through FastQC for quality assessment.

```
fastqc Po22/Pd8825_1.fq.gz
fastqc Po22/Pd8825_2.fq.gz
```
For ease of access, the resulting .html files generated by FastQC can be uploaded to the local computer. From the FastQC, it is clear that the overall quality is high, however, adaptor content is still present (~12%).

## Trimming
To remove adaptor content, the following Trimmomatic command-line was used to trim both forward and reverse sequences. 
```
java -jar ~/sequences/trimmomatic-0.38.jar PE -threads 2 -phred33 -trimlog Pd8825_errorlog.txt Pd8825_1.fq Pd8825_2.fq Pd8825_1_paired.fastq Pd8825_1_unpaired.fastq Pd8825_2_paired.fastq Pd8825_2_unpaired.fastq ILLUMINACLIP:adaptors.fasta:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:20:20 MINLEN:140
```
Another FastQC revealed the adaptor content reduced to ~2% in the resulting trimmed sequences.

The following table summarizes the results from Trimmomatic:

|  Sequence  | Reads | Adaptor Content |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Raw Forward  | 7692782  | ~12% |
| Raw Reverse  | 7692782  | ~12% |
| Trimmed Forward  | 6356740  | ~2% |
| Trimmed Reverse  | 6356740  | ~2% |

***NOTE:** HTML files from the FastQC before and after trimming can be found under the `FastQC results` directory.*
