# MyGenome
*The following is a basic record of the methods and results from the whole genome assembly of rice blast fungus, Pyricularia oryzae.*

## Sequence quality assessment
Upon upload of the sequences as .gz files, both forward and reverse sequences were run through FastQC for quality assessment.

```
fastqc Po22/Pd8825_1.fq.gz
fastqc Po22/Pd8825_2.fq.gz
```
For ease of access, the resulting .html files generated by FastQC can be uploaded to the local computer. From the FastQC, it is clear that the overall quality is high, however, adaptor content is still present (~12%).
